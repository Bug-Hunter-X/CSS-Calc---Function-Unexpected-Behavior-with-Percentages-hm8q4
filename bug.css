The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you try to use the `calc()` function with percentages and other units improperly, it might lead to unexpected results. For example, using `width: calc(100% + 10px);` will work correctly. But, using something like `width: calc(100% + 10%);` might not behave as intended because the percentage is relative to the parent element's width and cannot be directly added to another percentage without proper context.
